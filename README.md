ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dave Megarry, @poweredbypixiedust I'm a Product Manager at [CallMiner](https://callminer.com) where I focus on platform integrations, typically with REST or Webhooks.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve been coding since 1984, both as a hobbyist, pro bono and professionally, covering:
* BASIC
* C
* C++
* C#/.NET from early 2000s to current
* Objective-C
* Pascal
* FORTRAN 
* Assembly (Motorola, Intel, ARM (RPi)), 
* Web (inc HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, React)
* Unity & Unreal
* Python - focusing on API integrations, SQL data storage, cleansing data for ML

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying 2 things:
* iOS with Swift, building out a full product to be released
* NAND to Tetris - starting with just a NAND gate, building out a virtual computer including logic, processor, RAM and moving into developing device specific Machine Language that is used to layer on a custom high-level language. [NAND2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
